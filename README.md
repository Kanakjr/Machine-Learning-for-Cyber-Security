## Useful Resources

If you want to learn more about machine learning in cybersecurity, here are books that can help:

[AI for Cybersecurity by Cylance](https://pages.cylance.com/en-us-introduction-to-ai-book.html?_ga=2.89683291.1595385041.1538052662-139740503.1538052662) (2017) - Short but good introduction to basics of ML for Cybersecurity. Good practical examples.

[Machine Learning and Security ](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920065555.do)by O’reilly ( January 2018 ) — Best book so far about this topic but very few examples of Deep Learning and mostly a general Machine Learning

[Machine Learning For Penetration Testers](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-machine-learning-penetration-testing), by Packt ( July 2018 )- Less fundamental than previous one, but have more Deep Learning approaches
